# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Distributed Training

For this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

The second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  

### Solving the Environment

Note that your project submission need only solve one of the two versions of the environment. 

#### Option 1: Solve the First Version

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

#### Option 2: Solve the Second Version

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents.  In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. 

### Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
3. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgainBot/Project2-ContinuousControl.git
cd Project2-ContinuousControl/python
pip install .
```
Or instead take advantage of the `requirements.txt` included in this repo and run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```
5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu. 

#### In addition, follow the steps below to install the environment of the Unity agent

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    - **_Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the GitHub repository you cloned in the previous step, in the `Project2-ContinuousControl/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Core Files in this Repo
- `ddpg_agent.py`: adapted the original code from lessons
- `model.py`: modified NN strucutre: included batch normalization layer and added one more hidden layer to Actor
- `actor.pth`: saved model weights for the Actor
- `critic.pth`: saved model weights for the Critic
- `Continuous_Control.ipynb`: notebook containing the solution and the plot of scores

### Instructions to run the code

- To replicate the result, after setting up the environment as instructed in Dependencies section, you can run the notebook `Continuous_Control.ipynb` step by step. The notebook allows you to determine the number of episodes to run and maximum timesteps in each episode by passing them into the `ddqp` fucntion defined in part 3 of the notebook.

- To tweak the models, you can either go to the `ddpg_agent.py` or the `model.py` file.
    -  In `ddpg_agent.py`, you can tune the following hyperparamters: 
	- buffer_size = int(1e6)  # replay buffer size
	- batch_size = 128        # minibatch size
	- gamma = 0.99            # discount factor
	- tau = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters
	- lr_actor = 1e-3         # learning rate of the actor 
	- lr_critic = 1e-3        # learning rate of the critic
	- weight_decay = 0        # L2 weight decayf the critic
	- learn_every = 20        # learning timestep interval
	- learn_num = 10          # number of learning passes
	- grad_clipping = 1.0     # gradient clipping
	- actor_fc1_units = 400   # number of units for the layer 1 in the actor model
	- actor_fc2_units = 300   # number of units for the layer 2 in the actor model
	- critic_fcs1_units = 400 # number of units for the layer 1 in the critic model
	- critic_fc2_units = 300  # number of units for the layer 2 in the critic model
    - In `model.py`, you can modify the NN structure by editing the `Actor` and `Critic` classes.
    
- To watch the trained smart agent, load the weights from `actor.pth` and `critic.pth` and run 

### Result

The trained agent is able to solve the problem in slightly more than 100 episodes.
